# Introduction
## Exercise 1
Write a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter will be  a random number between 0 and 10, the second parameter will be a number. If the random number match to the second parameter, the program will display "Good work" otherwise display a message "Not matched".

Give a example of execution program

Hint: Math.random() and Math.floor()

## Exercise 3

Write a functionthat takes t wo numbers parameters and return the larger.

## Exercise 4

Write a JavaScript program that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

*Sample Output* :
```javascript
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"
```

## Exercise 5

Write a function that takes one argument and return the type of argument

## Exercise 6

1. Create a two global variables `a` and `b`, initialized respactively by `3` and `4`.

2. Create a function `multiply` that multiply variables `a` and `b`

## Exercise 7

Write a JavaScript program that determine if a year is a year leap or not.

Hint: As a reminder, a year is leap if it is divisible by 4 without being divisible by 100 or divisible by 400 (cf. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year))

## Exercise 8

Write a function that takes two parameters two positive numbers and returns the largest common divisor (GCD).
